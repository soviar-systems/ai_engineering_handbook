The choice between JSON, YAML, and Markdown is not cosmetic -- it changes the signal-to-noise ratio in the transformer's attention budget and may bias the model toward different processing modes. We present a token-level analysis, BPE tokenizer mechanics, empirical measurements on a production prompt, and a decision framework for choosing prompt delivery format."

    "### 2.7 Why Formats Differ: BPE Tokenizer Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "The token differences are not arbitrary -- they follow directly from how Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space+word merging.** Most BPE tokenizers (cl100k_base, o200k_base, Llama) treat a space followed by a word as a single token. The sequence ` hello` (space-prefixed) is one token, while `hello` without a leading space is a different token. This is why YAML's `key: value` structure is efficient -- the space after the colon merges with the following word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indentation cost.** BPE tokenizers compress runs of spaces, but not infinitely. Four spaces might be one token, but eight spaces is typically two tokens. Deep nesting (common in YAML `|` blocks) accumulates an \"indentation tax\" -- each line pays for its leading whitespace. This is why YAML literal style is more expensive than standard YAML, which keeps values on the same line as keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Punctuation merging.** Tokenizers trained on code (which is most modern tokenizers) have merged common patterns like `{\"`, `\":`, `\"}` into single tokens. This is why minified JSON is so efficient -- the structural characters are already in the tokenizer's vocabulary as merged pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why you cannot remove all whitespace.** BPE tokenizers are trained on text with spaces between words. Removing inter-word spaces (e.g., `Thecatisfast`) forces the tokenizer into sub-word fragments it was not trained to interpret. The model can still decode it, but it spends reasoning capacity on parsing rather than understanding. Structural whitespace (indentation, newlines) can be removed; semantic whitespace (between words) cannot."

    "| YAML Literal (`\\|`) | 2,798 | +492 (+21.3%) |\n",
    "\n",
    "With `o200k_base` (GPT-4o), the ranking holds: Minified JSON = 2,313 tokens, Standard YAML = 2,480 tokens. The larger vocabulary compresses both formats almost equally, preserving the relative gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minified JSON is the token champion** -- 21% cheaper than the most expensive format. If you are strictly budget-constrained or hitting a context window limit, `jq -c` is the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard YAML beats raw JSON** -- by 252 tokens (9.2%). The colons-and-indentation structure is genuinely more token-efficient than braces-and-quotes. This contradicts the naive assumption that \"less punctuation = fewer tokens\"; what matters is how well the format aligns with BPE merge patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **YAML literal (`|`) is the most expensive** -- even more than pretty-printed JSON. The indentation tax on every line inside a `|` block overwhelms the savings from removing quotes. This is the most counterintuitive finding: the \"most readable\" YAML variant is the \"most expensive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Token efficiency ≠ reasoning quality.** Minified JSON saves tokens but eliminates the structural signposts (newlines, indentation) that help the transformer maintain positional awareness. Standard YAML costs 7.6% more than minified JSON but provides attention anchors that improve instruction adherence in complex prompts. For most production use cases, the 176-token difference is worth the reasoning quality gain."

    "### 7.1 The \"Out-Indenting\" Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "In YAML or any indentation-scoped format, hierarchy is determined by whitespace depth. If user-generated content is dynamically inserted into an indented block, a malicious input can \"out-indent\" -- using fewer leading spaces to escape the intended scope and inject instructions at a higher level of the prompt hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if user input is inserted at 4-space indentation depth, an attacker can submit content with 0-space indentation to place instructions at the root level, potentially overriding system instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Terminal anchors.** End critical instruction blocks with explicit markers (e.g., a new top-level key) so that scope cannot be extended by injected content.\n",
    "- **Programmatic indentation enforcement.** When inserting dynamic content, strip all leading whitespace and re-indent programmatically to the intended depth. Never trust user-supplied indentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "JSON and XML have explicit delimiters (`}`, `</tag>`) that are harder to forge in free-text input. YAML and Markdown rely on whitespace, which is invisible and easy to manipulate. If your prompt pipeline inserts untrusted content, prefer delimiter-based formats for the injection boundary or sanitize aggressively."

YAML literal (`|`) should be avoided unless you need exact whitespace preservation -- it is the most expensive format.\n",
