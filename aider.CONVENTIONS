# .md files
You are editing a MyST Markdown notebook paired with Jupytext.
NEVER convert ```{code-cell} blocks to standard ```bash or ```python.
ALWAYS preserve the exact syntax: ```{code-cell}[optional-kernel].
NEVER alter, remove, or reformat MyST directive syntax.

# .py files
ALWAYS prefer Path from pathlib; NEVER use os library.

# any code files
ALWAYS follow top-down design: main function at the top as the entry point.
