When a user hits "enter" after typing a prompt, the system triggers a complex collaboration between the Central Processing Unit (**CPU**) and the Graphics Processing Unit (**GPU**). This is called **Hybrid Execution**.

Your job as an AI Engineer is to manage the trade-offs between CPU's vast memory capacity and GPU's raw speed. Where should your precious data live and be processed?

## 0. Expanding Vocabulary: Throughput vs. Latency Metrics

Performance metrics are often confused, yet understanding their distinctions is critical to optimizing Local LLM inference. Let's clarify the key terms engineers use to measure model responsiveness and speed.

### Key Metrics Overview

| Metric | What It Measures | Dominant Phase | Hardware Bottleneck | Relationship |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Time To First Token (TTFT)**| Latency: time to generate the first token | Prefill | SSD speed, PCI-E bus bandwidth | Independent of TPS |
| **Time Per Output Token (TPOT)** | Latency: time to generate each subsequent token | Decode | GPU VRAM bandwidth | $$\text{TPOT} = \frac{1}{\text{TPS}}$$ |
| **Tokens Per Second (TPS)** | Throughput: tokens generated per second | Decode | GPU VRAM bandwidth | $$\text{TPS} = \frac{1}{\text{TPOT}}$$ |

### Definitions and Context

* **Latency (TTFT and TPOT)** measures the **delay experienced per event**:

    * **TTFT** quantifies the delay from input prompt submission to the very first output token, heavily influenced by SSD read speeds and data transfer bottlenecks.
    * **TPOT** captures the time it takes to generate each *additional* token, driven by VRAM memory bandwidth during sequential decoding.

* **Throughput (TPS)** measures how many tokens your model generates per second *after* the initial response starts. This reflects the model’s **sustained generation speed** during the **Decode Phase**. Higher TPS indicates faster completion and better scalability.

### Why This Distinction Matters

Optimizing local LLM inference is fundamentally a balancing act between **minimizing latency** and **maximizing throughput**:

- A **low TTFT** means the model starts responding quickly, which is crucial for user experience. But aggressively optimizing prompt loading (SSD/CPU) may waste GPU bandwidth later.
- A **high TPS** means the model can churn through tokens fast during long outputs, key for scalability and throughput. However, this often requires ample VRAM bandwidth and efficient memory management.

> **Insight for Engineers:**
> When colleagues say “optimize TPS,” they mean reducing bandwidth bottlenecks during token generation. This is often achieved by managing the **KV Cache** effectively or applying **quantization** to reduce data size.

### Latency-Throughput Relationship Diagram

```

### Practical Example

Consider the **Mistral 7B model on an 8GB VRAM GPU with 32GB RAM**:

- A **TTFT of 0.5 seconds** means the initial prompt is processed rapidly — user sees a quick first response.
- A **TPS of $\sim 20$ tokens/sec** means the model generates subsequent tokens quickly, allowing smooth continuation.

However, these two goals can compete for resource allocation — optimizing for one may degrade the other, so thoughtful system tuning is necessary.

## 1. The Local Inference Pipeline: A Guided Scenario

We will follow a typical prompt journey using the scenario: running a **Mistral 7B** model locally with a high-end CPU, 32GB system RAM, and a consumer 8GB VRAM GPU.

### 1.1 Phase 1: The Prefill (Fast, Parallel Compute)

The model processes the entire prompt in parallel during this phase, marked by high GPU utilization and measured as **Time To First Token (TTFT)**.

  * **Goal:** Quickly process the input sequence to generate the first token and build the initial **Key-Value Cache (KV Cache)**.
  * **Action:** The CPU tokenizes text and coordinates slow PCI-E transfers of weights/data to GPU. The GPU then executes parallel matrix multiplications.
  * **Workflow Visualization:** Note the data transfer bottleneck across PCI-E and the computational dominance of the GPU cores.

| Step | Device Dominant | Action | Primary Bottleneck |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1. Cold Start / I/O | **CPU** | Load weights from SSD to system RAM | SSD sequential read speed |

| 3. Compute & Cache | **GPU** | Matrix multiplies, builds KV Cache | VRAM bandwidth, GPU FLOPS $\dagger$ |

$\dagger$ *GPU compute (FLOPS) is rarely the true bottleneck. Real-world Prefill is **memory-bound** by VRAM bandwidth feeding data to cores.*

### 1.2 Phase 2: The Decode (Sequential Memory Access)

#### Latency: Time Per Output Token (TPOT)

After the first token is generated, subsequent tokens are created one at a time referencing the expanding KV Cache. The loop is bandwidth-bound and measured by **Time Per Output Token (TPOT)**.

  * **Goal:** Efficiently generate tokens referencing the conversation's entire history in the KV Cache.
  * **Action:** GPU fetches weights and KV Cache repeatedly from VRAM as the cache grows linearly.

```

#### Throughput: Tokens Per Second (TPS)

**Tokens Per Second (TPS)** is the standard performance metric used to measure the **throughput** or **speed** of an LLM serving engine. It is the reciprocal of TPOT, or $\text{TPS} = 1 / \text{TPOT}$.

## 2. The VRAM/RAM Trap: Bottlenecks and Hybrid Execution

### 2.1 The Key-Value (KV) Cache: The VRAM Killer

The KV Cache stores attention vectors for past tokens, significantly reducing computations but consuming high-speed GPU VRAM.

| KV Cache Characteristic | Engineering Challenge |
|:---|:---|
| **Linear Growth** | Cache size grows linearly with conversation length. |
| **VRAM Limit** | Cache saturation (e.g., 8GB VRAM) causes stalls or crashes. |

**Memory Pressure Timeline:**

```

> **🔥 Critical Pitfall:** Exceeding 4,000 tokens on 8GB VRAM stalls or crashes inference without aggressive memory management.

### 2.2 KV Cache Offloading: The Hybrid Solution

Hybrid execution frameworks like `llama.cpp` offload KV Cache blocks to CPU RAM when VRAM fills.

- **The Solution:** Page older KV Cache parts from GPU VRAM to CPU RAM (32GB).
- **Trade-off:** Access latency increases due to PCI-E transfers causing **$5\times - 10\times$ slower TPOT**.

**Offloading Event Workflow:**

    CPU->>GPU: Transfer via PCI-E
    GPU->>VRAM: Store block (evict LRU if needed)

```

| Bottleneck | Symptom/Error | Cause | **Actionable Troubleshooting** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|

Reduce context window to 2K tokens<br>3. Enable *partial* KV cache offloading [→ Deep Dive: Quantization Trade-offs] |
| **Memory Crash** | Fatal VRAM error at $\sim 4\text{K}$ tokens | **KV Cache $>$ VRAM capacity** (e.g., 4.2GB cache on 8GB VRAM GPU) | 1. **Enable KV cache offloading**<br>2. Set `--cache-offload-percentage 70`<br>3. Monitor VRAM usage pre-crash [→ Deep Dive: Memory Management] |

## 3. Frameworks: The Hybrid Execution Engines

Real-world hybrid execution depends on **inference kernels** that optimize CPU/GPU coordination. Key players in 2025:

| Framework | Hybrid Execution Superpower | Critical Limitation | Mistral-7B (8GB VRAM) Tip |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **llama.cpp** | **KV cache offloading** + CPU/GPU layer splitting | High CPU overhead during paging | `n_gpu_layers=40` + `--split-mode row` |
| **vLLM** | PagedAttention™ (unified VRAM/RAM cache) | Requires NVIDIA datacenter GPUs | ❌ Not consumer-GPU compatible |
| **HuggingFace TGI** | Speculative decoding + pipeline parallelism | No CPU offload support | Use only with 16GB+ VRAM GPUs |

**llama.cpp Layer Splitting Explained**

The most effective hybrid technique for `llama.cpp` on consumer hardware is **layer splitting**. This assigns the computation for the model's **lower layers** (which are mostly compute-heavy) to the **GPU**, while the **upper layers** (which are more memory-intensive and interact heavily with the growing KV Cache) are strategically placed on the **CPU** (using RAM). This balances the workload and maximizes GPU utilization for the most parallelizable tasks.

**💡 Battle-Tested Insight**:

For **local deployments** (our scenario), **llama.cpp** is the *only* framework that reliably handles KV cache offloading on consumer GPUs. Its **GGUF quantization support** (Q4\_K\_M) and **CUDA graph capture** make it the de facto standard for sub-24GB VRAM setups.

## 4. Quantization: The Enabler for Local LLMs

Quantization is the process of reducing the precision of the model's weights (e.g., from 16-bit to 4-bit integers), which dramatically cuts the model's VRAM footprint and memory bandwidth requirement.

### Trade-offs of Quantization

| Aspect | Description | Impact |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Model Size** | Reduces weight size by $4\times$ (from 16-bit to 4-bit). | **Critical:** Allows models to fit into limited VRAM (e.g., Mistral 7B $\approx 14\text{GB}$ FP16 $\rightarrow \approx 4.5\text{GB}$ Q4\_K\_M). |
| **Inference Speed** | Reduces the size of the data moved over the VRAM bus. | **Positive:** Increases effective VRAM bandwidth, leading to higher **TPS** during the Decode phase. |
| **Accuracy** | Loss of precision can introduce small errors. | **Minor:** Modern formats (e.g., Q4\_K\_M, Q5\_K\_S) mitigate this, with negligible quality drop for many tasks. |

### The Power of GGUF (Q4\_K\_M)

The `llama.cpp` framework's **GGUF** format is the standard for local LLM quantization. The **Q4\_K\_M** variant uses advanced techniques (like per-channel scaling and K-means clustering) to achieve high compression with minimal accuracy loss.

| Model | Original Size (FP16) | Q4\_K\_M Size (GGUF) | VRAM Saved |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Mistral 7B | 14 GB | 4.4 GB | 68.5% |

> **Engineering Mandate:** Always deploy the highest practical quantization (e.g., Q4\_K\_M or Q5\_K\_M) before resorting to full KV Cache offloading, as quantization is a **global speed optimization**, whereas offloading is a **localized latency penalty.**

## Key Takeaways for the AI Engineer

1.  **TTFT vs. TPOT:** TTFT is CPU/SSD latency; TPOT is GPU/VRAM bandwidth.
2.  **Bandwidth over FLOPs:** Decode speed depends more on memory bandwidth than raw compute.
3.  **Quantization First:** Use GGUF to reduce memory footprint and boost effective VRAM bandwidth.
4.  **Hybrid Execution is Necessary:** Must configure KV Cache offloading for large models or long contexts on consumer hardware.

> **✅ Checkpoint Answer:** TTFT confirms Prefill ran well. TPS drop signals **KV Cache Offloading** is active, with slow PCI-E reads causing up to $10\times$ latency.

## Appendix A: Deep Dive on Compute vs. Bandwidth

**GPU FLOPS Decoded: Theoretical Peak vs. Real World**

**FLOPS** (Floating Point Operations Per Second) measures a GPU’s *theoretical peak* compute throughput for matrix math. **However, LLM inference rarely saturates FLOPS** due to memory constraints.

**⚠️ Critical Reality Check:**

In *actual* LLM workloads:

  * **VRAM bandwidth** (not FLOPS) limits speed 95% of the time.
  * FLOPS utilization rarely exceeds $30\% - 40\%$ due to memory stalls.
  * Quantized models (INT4) further reduce FLOPS utilization by $60\% - 70\%$ because the integer operations bypass the high-speed floating-point units.

**💡 When FLOPS *Actually* Matters:**

Only when **all** these conditions are met:

1.  Weights **fully pre-loaded** in VRAM (no PCI-E transfers during prefill).
2.  Prompt length **$> 1,024$ tokens** (sufficient parallelism).
3.  Using **FP16/BF16 precision** (no quantization).
4.  **Optimized kernels** (e.g., FlashAttention-2).

**Example: The RTX 4090 ($83 \text{ TFLOPS } \text{FP}16$)**

The $83 \text{ TFLOPS}$ FP16 rating for an RTX 4090 is a *peak theoretical number*, useful for comparing raw potential—but **not a predictor of LLM inference speed** in real deployments. This number is achievable only under ideal conditions (dense matrices, perfect memory access) that modern LLM workloads (sparse, memory-bound attention layers) rarely meet.

**Real-world LLM inference** on an RTX 4090 typically achieves **$< 25 \text{ TFLOPS}$ effective throughput**—often much lower during decode due to memory-bound behavior.

**Key Takeaway**: The Prefill phase is **memory-bound (VRAM bandwidth)**, *not* compute-bound. Optimizing TTFT requires maximizing VRAM bandwidth utilization and ensuring weights are pre-loaded.
