    "Contextualized embeddings are what make transformers so powerful compared to earlier approaches like `Word2Vec` or `GloVe`. Let me draw you a quick comparison:\n",

    "| **Static Embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe) | **Contextualized Embeddings** (Transformers) |\n",
    "|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Each word has one fixed vector | Each word's vector depends on its context |\n",
    "| \"bank\" in \"river bank\" vs \"money bank\" = same vector | \"bank\" gets different vectors based on surrounding words |\n",

    "## Our Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here's the beautiful part: **we won't implement \"contextualized embeddings\" as a separate component** - they emerge naturally from the self-attention mechanism we'll build in Stage 2!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain it like this: Imagine you're in a room full of people having multiple conversations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static embeddings** are like giving everyone a name tag that never changes\n",
    "- **Contextualized embeddings** are like watching how each person actually behaves in different conversations - their \"meaning\" changes based on who they're talking to\n",
    "\n",
    "In our transformer, the self-attention mechanism is what creates these contextualized representations. Each word looks at all other words in the sentence and dynamically adjusts its own representation based on what it sees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Magic Happens Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stage 1**: We'll start with simple, static token embeddings (just converting tokens to vectors)\n",
    "2. **Stage 2**: We'll build the self-attention mechanism that transforms these static embeddings into contextualized ones\n",
    "3. **The Emergence**: Through multiple layers of self-attention, each token's representation becomes increasingly contextualized\n",
    "\n",
    "So to answer your question directly: **Yes, we absolutely will implement contextualized embeddings** - but we'll build them the way transformers actually do it, through the self-attention mechanism rather than as a separate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this approach make sense to you? Are you curious about any particular aspect of how self-attention creates these contextual representations?\n",
    "\n",
    "*I'll wait for your thoughts before we dive into the tokenizer.*"
