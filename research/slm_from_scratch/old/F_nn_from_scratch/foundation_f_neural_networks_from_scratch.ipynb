    "1. **Principle of Least Surprise**: Most ML practitioners expect `gradient()` to be self-contained\n",
    "2. **API Safety**: Prevents subtle bugs from incorrect call sequences  \n",
    "3. **Standard Pattern**: Matches how frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow work internally\n",

    "\n",

    "- **Your preferred style**: Explicit dependencies, cleaner separation of concerns\n",
    "- **Standard approach**: Implicit forward call, more robust for general use\n",
    "\n",
    "In systems architecture, we often choose the **more robust** pattern over the **theoretically pure** one, especially for user-facing APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, this means `forward()` might be called twice if someone does:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = neuron.forward(X)\n",
    "grads = neuron.gradient(X, y_true)  # forward() called again internally\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But in practice:\n",
    "- The computational cost is negligible for a single neuron\n",
    "- The safety benefit outweighs the minor redundancy\n",
    "- In training loops, you typically only call `gradient()` anyway\n",
    "\n",
