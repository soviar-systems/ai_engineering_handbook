- Started a new mentor.
    - Updated `mentor_llm_from_scratch.json` with new metadata, core mission, mentor profile, interaction flow, response architecture, additional context, and user state management.
- Added `.aider*` to `.gitignore`.
- Created new notebook `01_foundational_neurons_and_backprop/01_foundations.ipynb` with foundational neuron and backpropagation content.
- Renamed `01_tokenizer/` to `02_tokenizer/`.
- Updated `README.md` with a new learning plan, goals, and practical skills.
- Moved older notebooks to the new directory `old/`.

**Date:** 2025-11-26
- Updated `01_foundational_neurons_and_backprop/01_foundations.ipynb` with enhanced mathematical notation and added exercises for scalar neuron backpropagation.
    - Added Exercise 2.1: Scalar Neuron Backpropagation.
    - Added Exercise 2.2: Implement the scalar neuron (Steps 1–2) in NumPy.
- Corrected the implementation of the hyperbolic tangent function in `01_foundational_neurons_and_backprop/01_foundations.ipynb` to use `np.tanh(z)` for numerical stability.
- Updated `mentor_llm_from_scratch.json` with changes to the state update mode triggers.
