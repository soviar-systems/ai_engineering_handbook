    "The custom local hook `sync_and_verify.sh` acts as the \"enforcement officer\" for Semantic Notebook Versioning. It solves the fundamental limitation of `pre-commit`: the framework's automatic stashing of unstaged changes, which \"hides\" the `.ipynb` file if you only staged the `.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Logic Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "The script operates in three distinct stages for every changed file passed to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment-Aware Synchronization:** Unlike official hooks that run in isolated containers, this script uses `uv run jupytext --sync`. This ensures Jupytext respects your local `pyproject.toml` settings, project-specific dependencies, and `kernelspec` definitions, preventing \"metadata hallucinations\" or random indentation shifts.\n",
    "2. **The Staging Attempt:** The script explicitly runs `git add` for both the `.md` and `.ipynb` members of the pair. While `pre-commit` prevents hooks from silently adding *new* (i.e. previously unstaged) files to a commit, this step ensures that if both files were already known to the index, they are updated to their latest synced state.\n",
    "    :::{attention} No silent staging\n",
    "    The hook does not stage files that were not staged before commit started. This is intentional.\n",

    "    :::\n",
    "4. **The Integrity Check (The \"Gatekeeper\"):** This is the most critical step. The script inspects the actual **Git Index** (`git diff --cached`) to verify that both files are staged together.\n",
    "* **If the pair is incomplete:** The hook fails and prints a specific `git add` command.\n",
    "* **The Result:** You are prevented from pushing a \"broken\" commit where the Markdown logic and Notebook execution state have diverged.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} **Why it \"Fails\" for Aider**  \n",
    "Because Aider only edits the `.md` file, the `.ipynb` file remains \"unstaged\" even after the sync. The hook detects this mismatch and blocks the commit, providing the exact `git add` command needed to include the execution state. This prevents \"logic-only\" commits that leave the notebook artifact behind.\n",

    "* **Environment Isolation:** It creates a fresh environment that doesn't \"see\" your `pyproject.toml` or `uv` environment.\n",
    "* **Metadata Sensitivity:** It is often too strict with Jupyter UI state (like `jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed`), leading to failed commits for non-code changes.\n",
