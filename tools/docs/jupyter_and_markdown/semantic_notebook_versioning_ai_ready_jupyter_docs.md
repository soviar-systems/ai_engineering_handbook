## **Executive Summary**

+++

This document establishes a **Production-Ready** protocol for AI engineering that bridges the gap between interactive data science and rigorous software engineering. By implementing **Semantic Notebook Versioning**, teams can achieve industrial-grade compliance with **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148** and **SWEBOK** standards.

+++

### Core Objectives

+++

* **Decouple Logic from State**: Separate human-readable MyST Markdown (source of truth) from JSON-based `.ipynb` artifacts (execution state).
* **Enable AI-Native Development**: Provide high-fidelity, token-efficient Markdown inputs optimized for Small Language Models (SLMs) and AI assistants like Aider.
* **Enforce Artifact Integrity**: Utilize automated Git hooks and CI pipelines to ensure synchronization and prevent "metadata noise" from polluting the version history.

+++

### Stakeholder Benefits

+++

* **For Lead Engineers**: Simplifies code reviews with clean, line-by-line diffs that focus exclusively on logic changes.
* **For AI/ML Developers**: Provides a stable environment where interactive exploration does not compromise GitOps-native workflows.
* **For Project Managers**: Ensures all development artifacts are **traceable, verifiable, and maintainable**, meeting international software quality criteria.

+++

### Standard Compliance Alignment

+++

The methodology is classified as **Production-Ready** because it adheres to the following frameworks:

+++

#### 1. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148: Requirements Engineering

+++

The standard mandates that specification artifacts be **unambiguous** and **maintainable**. This workflow achieves this by:

* **Verifiability**: Establishing the `.md` file as the primary source of truth, allowing for objective verification of logic independently of the execution environment.
* **Traceability**: Every change in the model’s architecture or logic is clearly traceable through Git, free from machine-generated JSON clutter.

+++

#### 2. SWEBOK Quality-2.1: Verifiability

+++

The Software Engineering Body of Knowledge emphasizes that development artifacts must be **verifiable**. By pairing `.md` and `.ipynb` files with a mandatory sync guard, we ensure that the interactive output is always a direct result of the stated logic, preventing "hidden state" discrepancies.

+++

#### 3. Simplest Viable Architecture (SVA)

The approach avoids vendor lock-in by using open-source tools (`uv`, `jupytext`, `myst`) and standard file formats, ensuring that the project remains fully functional on local CPU/RAM-limited stacks without proprietary overhead.

+++

## **Introduction**

+++

### Substantiation of the Approach: Architectural Rationale

+++

The adoption of semantic notebook versioning is not merely a workflow preference but a rigorous adherence to **industrial-grade MLOps criteria** and **Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)** standards. This methodology enforces the **Simplest Viable Architecture (SVA)** principle while ensuring development artifacts are traceable and verifiable.

+++

#### **1. Verifiability (SWEBOK Quality-2.1)**

+++

Standard `.ipynb` files are opaque JSON structures that obscure logic changes within metadata and execution noise. By promoting MyST Markdown as the primary source of truth, we ensure that every code modification is **verifiable** through human-readable Git diffs. The synchronization guard (Phase 4) serves as a formal verification step, ensuring that the execution artifact (`.ipynb`) and the specification artifact (`.md`) remain logically equivalent.

+++

#### **2. Unambiguous Specification (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148)**

+++

ISO 29148 requires specifications to be *unambiguous, verifiable, and maintainable*.

* **Unambiguity**: Decoupling the prose and code (logic) from the binary-encoded outputs prevents "hidden state" errors common in standard Jupyter workflows.
* **Traceability**: Each iteration of a model or algorithm is traceable in version control history without the interference of machine-generated metadata.
* **Maintainability**: The use of open formats (MyST Markdown) eliminates vendor lock-in, ensuring the project remains maintainable across diverse IDEs and AI-assisted environments.

+++

#### 3. Idempotency & State Determinism

+++

The Jupytext synchronization protocol is designed to be **idempotent**. In an AI engineering context, this ensures that the transformation from Markdown logic to a Notebook execution state is deterministic. By implementing `outdated_text_notebook_margin` and metadata filters, we mitigate "timestamp drift"—a common failure mode in distributed cloud-sync environments like Yandex.Disk—thereby maintaining the integrity of the project's **GitOps-native** pipeline.

+++

### Comparison of Standards Compliance

+++

| Criterion | Standard Jupyter Workflow | Semantic Versioning Workflow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Artifact Transparency** | **Low**: Logic buried in JSON. | **High**: Logic exposed in MyST Markdown. |
| **Reviewability** | **Difficult**: 500+ lines of noise. | **Seamless**: Line-by-line code diffs. |
| **AI Ingestion** | **Inefficient**: Wastes tokens on metadata. | **Optimized**: High-fidelity text inputs. |
| **Verifiability** | **Manual**: Relies on dev discipline. | **Automated**: Enforced by Sync Guards/CI. |

+++

### Files to work with

+++

1. UV environment: `pyproject.toml`
1. Aider:
    - `/.aider.conf.yml`
    - `/CONVENTIONS.md`
1. Git:
    - `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
    - `/.gitattributes`
    - `/.pre-commit-config.yaml`
    - custom hook `/helpers/scripts/hooks/sync_and_verify.sh`

:::{important}
For actual contents of the file inspect the original files in the repo, not the examples here.
:::

+++

## **Phase 1: Environment Provisioning**

+++

### Step 1: Configure Central JupyterLab Environment

+++

The Jupytext must be installed within the venv where your JupyterLab server is. 

**Why:** JupyterLab server extensions (like Jupytext) must be discoverable by the JupyterLab process. 

Assuming your JupyterLab is installed in `~/venv/jupyter`:

```{code-cell}
# Install Jupytext into the central environment
uv pip install -p ~/venv/jupyter/ jupytext
```

```{code-cell}
# Verify installation
~/venv/jupyter/bin/jupyter labextension list 2>&1 | grep jupytext
```

:::{important}
**Restart your JupyterLab server after installation** for the pairing commands to appear in the palette.
:::

+++

### Step 2: Configure Project Environment

+++

After cloning the repo, run from within the repo's root directory:

1. **Synchronize project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    
    This installs project-level dependencies to `.venv`:
    - `pre-commit` (required for Git hooks)
    - **Other project dependencies** (including project levelv Jupytext for synchronization in the project environment during the terminal level operations)
    
    :::{note}
    The project's `pyproject.toml` may list `jupytext` as a dependency for CLI operations (e.g., `uv run jupytext --sync`), but the **JupyterLab extension** must be installed in the central environment as shown in Step 1.
    :::

2. **Make hook scripts executable:**
    ```bash
    # Make all shell scripts in repo executable
    find . -type f -name '*.sh' -exec chmod 0755 {} +
    ```

+++

## **Phase 2: Markdown Priority Setup: The Git Attributes Diff Filter**

+++

Configure Git to treat the `.md` file as the primary source of truth for code reviews and LLM ingestion, while de-emphasizing the bulky `.ipynb` JSON.

File: `.gitattributes`:

```text
# Documentation/Logic: Primary Source for Diffs
*.md diff=markdown

# Execution/Output Artifact: Suppress in Diffs & PR UIs
*.ipynb linguist-generated=true
*.ipynb -diff
```

**Breaking Down the Code**

| Command | Real-World Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `*.md diff=markdown` | Tells Git: "Treat this as a document. When it changes, show me the words and code lines like a normal text file." |
| `*.ipynb linguist-generated=true` | Tells GitHub: "This file was made by a machine, not a human." GitHub will often hide these files by default in PR statistics. |
| `*.ipynb -diff` | Tells Git: "Do not calculate a line-by-line diff for this file." It treats the notebook as a binary "blob" (like a JPEG), significantly speeding up your Git operations and keeping PRs clean. |

**Why it is important**

In a standard setup, Git treats every file equally, but for Jupyter Notebooks, this creates a problem because `.ipynb` files are massive JSON objects filled with metadata, execution counts, and base64-encoded images that make code reviews impossible.

By using these `.gitattributes`, you are telling Git to **ignore the noise** and focus on the **human-readable** part of your work.

+++

:::{tip} Real-World Example: The Data Science Team Review
:class: dropdown
Imagine you are a Data Engineer working on a project called `data_cleaning.ipynb`. You change one line of code: you change `drop_na()` to `fillna(0)`.

| Aspect | Without Git Attributes | With Git Attributes |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Pull Request Diff** | 500+ lines of changes showing mostly JSON metadata (execution counts, cell IDs, binary strings) | Clean text-only diff showing only actual code changes |
| **Code Change Visibility** | Actual code change (e.g., `fillna(0)`) buried in middle of JSON block | Exact line highlighted: `- drop_na()` and `+ fillna(0)` |
| **Reviewer Experience** | Reviewer fatigue - must scroll through pages of noise to find logic changes | Review your changes using git diff *.md for a human-readable experience; `.ipynb` files diff will appear as "Binary files differ." |
| **File Focus** | .ipynb file shows full JSON diff with all metadata changes | .md file becomes primary source (with `diff=markdown`) |
| **.ipynb File Handling** | Shows complete diff of JSON structure | Shows "Binary file modified" or "Large diff hidden" (with `-diff` attribute) |
| **AI/LLM Integration** | Wastes tokens reading 5,000+ lines of JSON metadata | Reads only 50 lines of pure Markdown/Python logic |
| **Versioning Approach** | Standard notebook versioning with all metadata | Semantic notebook versioning focusing on code/logic |

Now, if you run `git diff` on `.ipynb` file manually, you should see something like this:

```bash
git diff research/slm_from_scratch/01_foundational_neurons_and_backprop/01_foundations.ipynb

diff --git a/research/slm_from_scratch/01_foundational_neurons_and_backprop/01_foundations.ipynb b/research/slm_from_scratch/01_foundational_neurons_and_backprop/01_foundations.ipynb
index e2faef2..f7c4e92 100644

Binary files a/research/slm_from_scratch/01_foundational_neurons_and_backprop/01_foundations.ipynb and b/research/slm_from_scratch/01_foundational_neurons_and_backprop/01_foundations.ipynb differ
```
:::

+++

## **Phase 3: Mandatory Pairing: Automate Jupytext Defaulting**

+++

To ensure the LLM assistant can read the semantic content of your work, every engineer must initialize notebook [pairing](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/main/docs/paired-notebooks.md).

+++

The `pyproject.toml` file in the **root of the repo** must contain these lines:

```toml
[tool.jupytext]
formats = "ipynb,md:myst"
```

When you open a notebook inside this folder using the central JupyterLab, Jupytext looks "up" the directory tree. It finds this file and automatically applies the "Pair with MyST" setting.

+++

:::{tip} Manual Alternative
:class: dropdown
If you ever need to do this operation manually (which is discouraged by our philosophy), in JupyterLab session open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+C`) and select:

```
Pair with myst md
```

## **Phase 4: Validation Gates**

+++

> 1. [Instruction on jupytext_verify_pair.py script](/tools/docs/scripts_instructions/jupytext_verify_pair_py_script.ipynb)
:::

+++

> "Jupyter keeps paired `.py` and `.ipynb` files in sync, but the synchronization happens only when you save the notebook in Jupyter. If you edit the `.py` file manually, then the `.ipynb` file will be outdated until you reload and save the notebook in Jupyter, or execute `jupytext --sync`."
> 
> — Jupytext official documentation

This means:
- If you edit the `.md` file in Aider → `.ipynb` is stale.
- If you open the `.ipynb` in Jupyter and save it → `.md` is up to date.
- If you commit without syncing → Git sees **two different versions** (one is outdated).

+++

### Pre-commit hook: Sync Guard

+++

:::{seealso}
> ADR 26002: Adoption of the Pre-commit Framework
:::

Before each commit, the hook runs:

```bash
jupytext --sync <file>
```

If the two files differ, the hook **fails** and the commit is blocked, forcing you to fix the inconsistency.

+++

### CI Verification

+++

To ensure that no desynchronized notebooks reach the main branch, add a CI check that validates all paired notebooks are in sync.

+++

## **Phase 5: Workflow for AI Engineering**

+++

In a real-world project, your workflow transitions from **active coding** to **version control** using the automation you have built.

- Keep both `.ipynb` and `.md` in Git
- Use `.md` for diffs, PRs, and Aider input
- Use `.ipynb` as the source for `myst build` (so outputs appear)
- Ensure `.ipynb` outputs are up-to-date before merge (via team discipline or CI execution)

This gives you:
- Clean diffs ✅  
- LLM-friendly input ✅  
- Rich, output-inclusive published docs ✅

Here is exactly what happens when you decide to commit your changes.

+++

### Human Workflow

+++

1. **Edit and Execute:** You work inside your `.ipynb` file using your central JupyterLab. You change a function and run the cell to see the output.

2. **Save (Ctrl+S):** When you save in JupyterLab, **Jupytext** immediately updates the paired `.md` file on your disk.
    * *Current state:* Both `.ipynb` and `.md` are updated.


3. **Stage Files for Git:** You go to your terminal or Git UI and add your changes:
    ```bash
    git add my_notebook.ipynb my_notebook.md

    # or just
    git add my_notebook.*
    ```

4. **The Commit (The Sync Guard):** You run your commit command:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "refactor: Update data cleaning logic"
    ```

    * **Pre-commit Trigger:** Your `pre-commit` hook kicks in. It runs `jupytext --sync`. If you accidentally edited the `.md` file with another tool (like VS Code or Aider) and forgot to sync it back to the `.ipynb`, the hook ensures they are identical before the commit is finalized.

+++

:::{warning}
If you've been editing the `.md` file outside the JupyterLab while `.ipynb` file is opened, do not click 'Save' in a stale JupyterLab tab before committing, as this may update the `.ipynb` timestamp and cause `jupytext --sync` to favor the old notebook content.

**The Risk**: If an engineer has a background process or an IDE extension (like a linter) that "touches" the `.ipynb` after they finished editing the `.md` via Aider, the `--sync` command might overwrite the AI's work with the older notebook state.
:::

+++

### AI-Assisted Workflow with Aider

+++

For smooth work with Aider you need to configure two files:
- `.aider.conf.yml`
- `CONVENTIONS.md`

:::{note} Alternative
:class: dropdown
You can inject a system prompt while working with Aider, like this one:

> *"After editing any .md file, always run 'jupytext --sync <file>' to ensure the paired notebook is updated."*

But this is error prone, because you have to add it manually each time you run Aider.
:::

+++

#### lint-cmd: Configure Commit Workflow

+++

We use Aider's `scripts` or `lint` functionality. By adding this to `.aider.conf.yml`, we tell Aider to treat a desynced notebook as a "linting error" and fix it automatically.

This configuration tells Aider to run the sync command whenever it modifies a file that has a notebook pair.

```yaml
# .aider.conf.yml

# Run Jupytext sync as a 'lint' step after Aider makes changes
lint-cmd:
  - "md: uv run jupytext --sync"
  - "ipynb: uv run jupytext --sync"

auto-lint: true
```

The commit workflow is now fully hands-off:

1. **AI Edit:** You tell Aider: *"Update the loss function in foundations.md."*
2. **Auto-Sync:** Aider finishes the edit. Because of our `lint-cmds` config, Aider automatically runs `jupytext --sync` behind the scenes.
3. **Atomic Commit:** You stage **both** files and commit them together.
4. **Sync Guard Approval:** The pre-commit hook runs, sees that the files are already perfectly in sync, and allows the commit to pass instantly.

+++

:::{important} aider auto-commits off
:class: dropdown
Aider's Auto-Commits fail in our workflow because when it edits `notebook.md`, it:

1. Modifies the `.md` file.
2. (Optionally) runs `lint-cmd` → updates `.ipynb` in working tree.
3. **Stages only the file it directly edited** (`notebook.md`).
4. **Does not stage `.ipynb`**, because aider **never touched it directly**.

Then it runs `git commit` → pre-commit fails → aider silently **aborts** to commit.

Even with `auto-lint: true`, **aider cannot stage files it didn't edit**. This is a **fundamental limitation** of aider's architecture.

> 🚫 **aider's auto-commits are incompatible with paired notebook workflows** that require atomic multi-file commits.

Thus, **disable aider commits** and treat it as an *editor only*:

```yaml
# .aider.conf.yml
auto-commits: false
```

Then:
1. Let aider edit `.md`.
2. Run `git add *.md`.
3. Run `git commit` → pre-commit syncs + fails.
4. Run `git add *.ipynb` → `git commit` → success.

This is **more reliable**, auditable, and aligns with **GitOps**.
:::

+++

#### CONVENTIONS.md file

+++

For more information see [official documentation](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/conventions.html).

In the repo's root directory create a file `CONVENTIONS.md`.

+++

##### Key Principles for aider-Centric `CONVENTIONS`

+++

1. **Ultra-concise**: Max 3–5 lines. aider's context window is precious.
2. **Imperative tone**: Direct commands, no explanations.
3. **Syntax-prescriptive**: Explicitly state **what to preserve** and **what to never change**.
4. **No examples**: Examples consume tokens and may be reinterpreted as editable content.

+++

##### Instructions

+++

Add these instruction to the file:

```
You are editing a MyST Markdown notebook paired with Jupytext.
NEVER convert ```{code-cell} blocks to standard ```bash or ```python.
ALWAYS preserve the exact syntax: ```{code-cell}[optional-kernel].
NEVER alter, remove, or reformat MyST directive syntax.
```

**Rationale**: This is **178 tokens** (including newlines)—minimal, unambiguous, and fits cleanly in aider's context without crowding the actual document.

+++

##### Implementation Protocol

+++

1. **Save this as `CONVENTIONS.md`**.
2. **Inject into aider context** via:
    ```yaml
    # .aider.conf.yml
    read: CONVENTIONS.md
    ```
    or in CLI:
    ```bash
    aider --read CONVENTIONS.md your_notebook.md
    ```

Now `CONVENTIONS.md` will be loaded to Aider automatically each time you start it.

:::{caution}
Do not forget to exclude the `CONVENTIONS.md` file from the MyST build process. See `myst.yml` file.
:::

+++

##### What **Not** to Do

+++

- **Do not add a "convention" telling aider to `git add notebook.ipynb`**—aider doesn't control staging logic directly; it relies on Git's changed-file detection.
- **Do not add human-style instructions** like "always commit both"—aider ignores narrative, and your automation already guarantees the outcome.

+++

### The Pull Request Experience

+++

When you push to GitHub, the workflow pays off for the **Reviewer**:

* **Reviewer opens the PR:** They see two files changed.
* **They click the `.md`:** They see a clean, line-by-line diff of your logic changes.
* **They ignore the `.ipynb`:** Because of your `.gitattributes`, GitHub collapses the `.ipynb` file. It's treated as an "artifact" (the execution state), while the `.md` is treated as the "source code."

+++

## **Phase 6: The "Logical Identity" Stalemate & Timestamp Drift**

+++

Jupytext is engineered to be **idempotent**. It prioritizes **content integrity** (code and prose) over **file metadata** (kernelspec ordering, display names, or execution counts). While this prevents "metadata noise" in Git, it can lead to a stalemate where your system thinks files are out of sync while Jupytext thinks they are identical.

+++

### The Problem: Metadata vs. System Clock

+++

A conflict occurs when the `.ipynb` file has a newer timestamp than the `.md` file, but the only difference is trivial metadata.

1. **JupyterLab** sees the newer timestamp on the `.ipynb` and blocks the file from opening to prevent overwriting "unsaved changes".
2. **Jupytext CLI** (`--sync` or `--update`) compares the actual code/text. If they match, it identifies them as **"Unchanged"** and refuses to write to the disk to preserve efficiency.
3. **The Result**: The timestamp mismatch remains, and the file stays "locked" in JupyterLab.

+++

### The Solution: Forcing a "Logical" Sync

+++

When the CLI reports "Unchanged" but JupyterLab still complains about timestamps, you must break the deadlock by explicitly defining the source of truth.

| Scenario | Recommended Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Markdown is Truth** | `uv run jupytext --to ipynb <file>.md` | **Overwrites** the notebook. Realigns metadata exactly to the `.md` state. **Wipes existing outputs.** |
| **Keep Outputs + Sync** | `uv run jupytext --update --to ipynb <file>.md` | Merges text changes into the notebook. **Preserves execution outputs.** |
| **Fix Clock Drift** | `touch <file>.md && uv run jupytext --sync <file>.md` | Artificially makes the `.md` the newest file, forcing Jupytext to "win" the timestamp race. |

+++

### Preventative Configuration

+++

To minimize these "safety locks" caused by cloud sync (e.g., Yandex.Disk) or minor metadata jitter, add a **safety margin** to your project configuration.

File: `jupytext.toml` (or `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.jupytext]`):

```toml
# Allow the notebook to be up to 60 seconds newer than the text file 
# without triggering a "stale" warning in JupyterLab.
outdated_text_notebook_margin = 60

# Filter out minor metadata changes that cause sync stalemates
notebook_metadata_filter = "-all"

```

:::{warning}
If an engineer has a background process or an IDE extension (like a linter) that "touches" the `.ipynb` after they finished editing the `.md` via Aider, the `--sync` command might favor the older notebook state. Always verify your Git status before and after syncing.
:::

+++

## **Semantic Notebook Versioning & Critical Maintenance Notes**

+++

* **Conflict Resolution**: If a merge conflict occurs, resolve it within the `.md` file. The pre-commit hook will then propagate those changes back to the `.ipynb`.
* **Sync Logic**: The `--sync` flag updates both files based on the **most recent timestamp**. Ensure your system clock is accurate when working across distributed environments.
