    "The **Stacked Diff** workflow is permitted as an **advanced implementation** of Atomic Change Submission, enabling high velocity and rapid peer review. This methodology involves breaking a large feature into a **series of small, dependent, atomic CLs** (Change Lists or Diffs) .\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Scope:** The entire feature remains **one logical change** to the system.\n",
    "2.  **Integration Method:** The default **Squash and Merge** is overridden. The stack is integrated using a specialized tool (e.g., Sapling, Graphite) that executes an atomic **Rebase and Merge** or **Fast-Forward Merge** for each sequential diff.\n",
    "3.  **Strict Condition:** This exception is **only** permitted if:\n",
    "    -   The work is managed through an approved Stacked Diff platform.\n",
    "    -   **Every single commit in the stack** must be independently reviewed, CI-verified, and comply with all Tier 1, 2, and 3 policies.\n",
    "4.  **Benefit:** The resulting mainline history is linear, atomic, and preserves the clean narrative of the feature’s development, thus **restoring the utility of `git bisect`** for diagnostics."
