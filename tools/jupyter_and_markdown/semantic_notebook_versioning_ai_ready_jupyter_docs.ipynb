    "#### 2. Merge conflicts break sync silently\n",

    "- Pre-commit only runs on *new commits*, not on *incoming changes* from `git pull` or PR merges.\n",
    "- Only CI (or a dedicated merge check) can catch this **post-merge drift**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Team heterogeneity\n",
    "- Not all contributors may run `pre-commit install` (e.g., external collaborators, CI-generated commits).\n",

    "#### Best Practice Alignment\n",

    "- **GitOps Principle**: *“Trust, but verify.”* Pre-commit is trust; CI is verification.\n",
