    "# Post-Mortem Report: SLM Non-Determinism in Stage 1\n",

    "## 1. Executive Summary and Architectural Mandate\n",
    "\n",
    "This report documents the architectural failure observed during the deployment of the **Small Language Model (SLM)** (1B-3B parameter class) for the highly frequent and highly constrained task of generating structured Conventional Commit messages (Pipeline **Stage 1**).\n",
    "\n",
    "> See [Production Git Workflow Standards](../../../mlops/git_workflows/production_git_workflow_standards.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying architectural decision to use the SLM was based on achieving efficiency at the edge. However, subsequent analysis revealed a critical mismatch between the **task requirement (100% deterministic, low-context output)** and the **model's capability (non-deterministic synthesis)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Detail | Status |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Issue Title** | Failure of 1B-3B SLM to reliably generate structured Conventional Commit messages. | **CLOSED** |\n",
    "| **Impact** | Non-deterministic output, violation of mandatory ArchTag rules, failure to adhere to the core formatting standard (e.g., imperative mood). | **CRITICAL** |\n",
    "| **Root Cause** | **Low Instruction Fidelity and Synthesis Limitation** in small (1B-3B) SLMs. The model could not maintain complex, simultaneous constraints (parsing raw diff, applying multiple rules, generating structured JSON) while conserving VRAM. | **Architectural** |\n",
    "| **Mandated Solution** | **Replace the LLM** in Stage 1 with a **Deterministic CLI Tool** (`gitlint`) to enforce the format. Limit the SLM role to the final, high-context Stage 3 transformation. | **MANDATORY** |\n",
    "\n",
    "> See [Tools: Commit & Changelog Tooling for Release Pipelines](../../../mlops/git_workflows/commit_changelog_tooling.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Introduction: Failure of a High-Frequency SLM Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Our testing confirmed that **Small Language Models (1B-3B) are not suitable for mandatory, high-frequency, structured parsing and generation tasks in a production MLOps pipeline.** Their inherent low **Instruction Fidelity** and difficulty maintaining complex, simultaneous constraints (e.g., 50-character limit, imperative mood, conditional ArchTag insertion) leads to non-deterministic, unreliable output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Result:** The SLM-generated commit messages failed to pass mandatory CI/CD gates, leading to a direct violation of the **[Production Git Workflow: Standards](../../../mlops/git_workflows/production_git_workflow_standards.md)**.\n",
    "* **Action:** We are immediately retiring the SLM from **Stage 1** of the pipeline. The function will be replaced by a deterministic, non-LLM CLI tool to enforce compliance via an interactive workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report reinforces the architectural principle that **LLMs must only be applied to generative, low-constraint transformation tasks, not deterministic parsing or rule-based enforcement.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Technical Diagnosis and Failure Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The failure was a direct result of mismatching the task complexity with the model's resource constraints. We attempted to use the SLM for a task that requires **high deterministic parsing capability** and **strict adherence to multiple rules**, a domain better suited to traditional software logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Two Points of Failure**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Failure Type | Description | Observed SLM Error |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Instruction Fidelity Breakdown** | The model's low parameter count led to confusion between the JSON system prompt and the required text output format. | **Hallucination of keys**, **ignoring imperative mood**, **omitting mandatory ArchTags**. |\n",
    "| **Synthesis and Context Overload** | The model had to hold the complex prompt rules (20+ lines) in context while simultaneously synthesizing a title/body from the large, noisy `git diff`. | **Ignoring the content of the diff** (e.g., using boilerplate text instead of synthesizing the actual change). **Failure to check the 50-character limit.** |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Final Mandate: Stage 1 Reversion and New Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "To guarantee **industrial-grade reliability** and compliance with the **Production Git Workflow: Standards**, we implement the following mandated architectural change:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Eliminate the LLM Role in Stage 1:** The 1B-3B SLM is explicitly **retired** from the commit message generation task.\n",
    "2.  **Enforce Format Deterministically:** All developers must use a dedicated, non-LLM command-line utility for creating commit messages.\n",
    "    * **Tool:** `gitlint` or a similar interactive CLI.\n",
    "3.  **LLM Role Restriction:** The SLM's function is now strictly limited to **Stage 3: Release Notes Transformation**, where it processes short, pre-validated `CHANGELOG.md` excerpts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mandate shifts the compliance burden from the brittle SLM synthesis step to the **developer's interactive workflow**, guaranteeing a clean input for the subsequent automated stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Next Steps for Engineers: Mandatory Actions 🛠️\n",
    "\n",
    "The following actions are mandatory to implement the new, deterministic architecture and align with the **Commit & Changelog Tooling Standard**. Compliance with these steps is enforced via the `pre-commit` hooks and CI/CD gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **SLM Decommissioning (Stage 1 Retirement):** Remove all local configurations and system prompts related to the 1B-3B SLM assisting with commit message generation. This role is permanently retired.\n",
    "2.  **Tool Installation:** All development environments **must** install and configure the mandated tooling stack:\n",
    "    * **Enforcement:** **`gitlint`** (via `pre-commit` hook) for mandatory commit message validation.\n",
    "    * **Generation:** **`git-chglog`** (single Go binary) for reproducible `CHANGELOG.md` creation.\n",
    "3.  **Workflow Change (Manual Creation):** Developers **must** ensure their commit messages adhere to the Conventional Commit standard, as they will be validated by **`gitlint`** before being accepted into the Git history. No automated message creation is approved.\n",
    "4.  **Training Material:** Training will be immediately deployed to outline the new manual yet validated commit workflow and the updated role of the SLM (now exclusively **Stage 3: Transformation**).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appendix A. Prompts Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**SLM Execution Sequence (Workflow)** - Expected\n",
    "\n",
    "The developer initiates this sequence within the CLI agent (`aider`) to the local SLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `/run git diff` and add output to context (110 lines changes in one file - a new file created)\n",
    "1. `/add <prompt.json>`\n",
    "1. `/ask generate commit message for git diff using instruction in <prompt.json>`\n",
    "1.  **SLM Process:** The 1B-3B model reads the instructions and performs a two-step transformation:\n",
    "      * **Step A (Classification):** It classifies the change type and determines if an `ArchTag` is mandatory.\n",
    "      * **Step B (Summarization/Formatting):** It synthesizes the diff into the structured output.\n",
    "1.  **Output:** The model returns the three lines of structured text, which the developer reviews and commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tested in `aider` with models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `deepseek-r1:1.5b-qwen-distill-q4_K_M`\n",
    "2. `qwen2.5-coder:3b-instruct-q5_K_M`\n",
