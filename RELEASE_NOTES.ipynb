    "## release v1.4.0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "This release significantly expands the **1_execution** and **4_orchestration** layers with deep-dives into high-performance computing standards (GEMM) and advanced MLOps architectural patterns. It also introduces a formal grounding of AI disciplines in alignment with ACM/IEEE curricula. A new GitHub Actions deployment workflow has been implemented to automate documentation builds using MyST.\n",
