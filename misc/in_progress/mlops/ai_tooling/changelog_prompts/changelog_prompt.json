      "SCAN: Review the commit messages first to identify the high-level intent, focusing on any embedded architectural tags (e.g., #REFACTOR-MIGRATION, #SECURITY-FIX).",
      "ANALYZE: Review the file diff output comprehensively, focusing on modified components and code impact.",
      "SCOPE (CRITICAL): Document all functional, dependency, and performance changes. Filter ONLY for minimal, non-functional code style changes. If any single change contains both a functional change and a cosmetic change, prioritize and document the functional change. DO NOT filter the entire commit.",
      "TRACEABILITY: The traceability tag MUST be the injected global reference $COMMIT_RANGE$ OR a mandatory architectural tag found in the commit messages for refactoring/removal entries.",
      "SUMMARIZE: Condense each change into a bullet point using the strict Markdown template.",
      "REFLECTION: Internally verify that every generated changelog entry includes the mandatory traceability tags before finalizing the output."
