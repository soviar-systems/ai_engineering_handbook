# Plan: Block-Based Prompt Architecture (SSoT)

**Date:** 2026-04-21
**Status:** Proposed
**Related ADRs:** ADR-26047 (Heuer), ADR-26048 (WRC)
**Goal:** Migrate monolithic consultant prompts to a JIT-composed block architecture to ensure Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for shared methodology, user stacks, and tradecraft.

## 1. Full Context Analysis

### Current State
Prompts are stored as monolithic JSON files in `ai_system_layers/3_prompts/consultants/`. Core logic (WRC, SVA, User Stack, Principles) is duplicated across these files.

**File Breakdown:**
- `ai_systems_consultant.json`: Contains full WRC/SVA logic, full user stack, core principles.
- `devops_consultant.json`: Contains full WRC/SVA logic, full user stack, core principles.
- `ai_brainstorming_colleague.json`: Contains partial user stack, partial principles.
- `handbook_consultant.json`: Contains partial user stack, partial principles.

### Directory Tree (Current)
```
ai_system_layers/3_prompts/consultants/
├── ai_brainstorming_colleague.json
├── ai_systems_consultant.json
├── devops_consultant.json
└── handbook_consultant.json
```

### Target State
Prompts are split into **Manifests** (consultant-specific) and **Blocks** (shared). `prepare_prompt.py` resolves these at runtime.

**Directory Tree (Target):**
```
ai_system_layers/3_prompts/consultants/
├── blocks/
│   ├── common_user_stack.json
│   ├── common_principles.json
│   ├── wrc_sva_framework.json
│   ├── standard_output_protocol.json
│   └── heuer_tradecraft.json
├── ai_brainstorming_colleague.json (Manifest)
├── ai_systems_consultant.json (Manifest)
├── devops_consultant.json (Manifest)
└── handbook_consultant.json (Manifest)
```

## 2. Cross-Reference Map

| Original File | Target Block / Manifest | Change Type |
|---|---|---|
| `ai_systems_consultant.json` $\rightarrow$ `user_stack` | `blocks/common_user_stack.json` | Move to Block |
| `ai_systems_consultant.json` $\rightarrow$ `principles` | `blocks/common_principles.json` | Move to Block |
| `ai_systems_consultant.json` $\rightarrow$ `wrc_sva` | `blocks/wrc_sva_framework.json` | Move to Block |
| `ai_systems_consultant.json` $\rightarrow$ `output_protocol` | `blocks/standard_output_protocol.json` | Move to Block |
| `devops_consultant.json` $\rightarrow$ `user_stack` | `blocks/common_user_stack.json` | Move to Block |
| `devops_consultant.json` $\rightarrow$ `wrc_sva` | `blocks/wrc_sva_framework.json` | Move to Block |
| All Consultants $\rightarrow$ Heuer Tradecraft | `blocks/heuer_tradecraft.json` | New Injection |

## 3. Task Rationale & Operations

### Task 1: Infrastructure Setup
**Rationale:** Create the storage location for reusable prompt fragments.
**Action:** `mkdir -p ai_system_layers/3_prompts/consultants/blocks/`

### Task 2: Block Extraction (SSoT)
**Rationale:** Isolate shared logic into atomic files to eliminate duplication.
**Blocks to create:**
- `common_user_stack.json`: The authoritative technical environment description.
- `common_principles.json`: "Emotionless", "Anti-bias", "Peer Review" rules.
- `wrc_sva_framework.json`: The full WRC formula, SVA C1-C6 constraints, and audit protocols.
- `standard_output_protocol.json`: The response structure, ISO 29148 tagging, and formatting rules.
- `heuer_tradecraft.json`: The procedural instructions for ACH and bias mitigation (from ADR-26047).

### Task 3: JIT Builder Upgrade (`prepare_prompt.py`)
**Rationale:** `prepare_prompt.py` must be upgraded from a simple reader to a recursive composer.
**Logic:**
1. Load JSON.
2. If `_includes` key exists, iterate through paths.
3. Recursively load and merge included JSON blocks.
4. Final merge: Consultant Manifest overrides $\rightarrow$ Block contents.
5. Remove `_includes` key from final output.

### Task 4: TDD Verification
**Rationale:** Ensure the builder handles edge cases safely.
**Test Scenarios:**
- **Zero Includes**: Standard JSON load.
- **Single Include**: Simple merge.
- **Multiple Includes**: Ordered merge.
- **Nested Includes**: Recursive resolution.
- **Missing File**: Exit with status 1 and clear error.
- **Circular Dependency**: Detection and error.

### Task 5: Manifest Migration
**Rationale:** Convert existing monoliths into clean manifests.
**Operation:**
1. Remove `user_stack`, `wrc_sva`, `principles`, and `output_protocol` sections.
2. Add `"_includes": ["blocks/common_user_stack.json", ...]` at the top.
3. Retain unique `persona`, `role`, and consultant-specific `goals`.
