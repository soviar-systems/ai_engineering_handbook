    - ADR 26014: Semantic Notebook Pairing Strategy (Jupytext).
    - ADR 26015: Mandatory Sync Guard and Diff Suppression.
* Tooling Ecosystem Overhaul:
    - New `check_script_suite.py` enforces the 1:1:1 convention (Script, Test, Documentation).
    - New `check_adr_index.py` validates ADR index synchronization.
    - New `check_link_format.py` ensures links point to `.ipynb` in paired files.
    - `prepare_prompt` refactored to Python (`prepare_prompt.py`) with multi-format support (JSON, YAML, TOML, Markdown) and JIT transformation.
    - `configure_repo` refactored to Python (`configure_repo.py`) for better cross-platform support.
    - `jupytext_sync` and `jupytext_verify_pair` updated for Semantic Notebook Pairing.
* Documentation & Standards:
    - `CONVENTIONS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated with MyST, Jupytext, and Script Suite guidelines.
    - Onboarding instructions updated to use `configure_repo.py`.
    - Documentation for all scripts centralized in `tools/docs/scripts_instructions/`.
* Content Organization:
    - Password management handbooks moved to `misc/in_progress`.
    - Prompts directory (`ai_system/3_prompts`) restructured for Prompts-as-Infrastructure.
* CI/CD & Quality:
    - Pre-commit hooks updated for new tools and Python-based scripts.
    - CI now checks all Markdown files for broken links.
    - API Key scanning improved with file exclusion lists.
