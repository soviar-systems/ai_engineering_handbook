release 2.4.0
* ADR Validation Toolchain:
    - `check_adr_index.py` renamed to `check_adr.py` with expanded scope: config-driven
      validation of required frontmatter fields, date format, tag allowlist, required sections,
      hyphen-format standardization (ADR-NNNNN), legacy migration (`--migrate`), partitioned
      index by status. 110 tests, 98% coverage.
    - Term reference validation added (`--check-terms`, `--fix-terms`) — detects and fixes
      broken `{term}` cross-references (e.g. `ADR 26001` → `ADR-26001`).
    - New `adr_config.yaml` as single source of truth for required sections, term reference
      patterns, and tag allowlists.
* Architecture Decisions (ADRs) added:
    - ADR-26016: Metadata-Driven Architectural Records Lifecycle.
    - ADR-26017: ADR Format Validation Workflow.
    - ADR-26018: Universal YAML Frontmatter Adoption for Machine-Readable Documentation.
    - ADR-26019: Mirroring YAML Metadata to Document Body for Human Verification.
    - ADR-26020: Hub-and-Spoke Ecosystem Documentation Architecture.
    - ADR-26021: Content Lifecycle Policy for RAG-Consumed Repositories.
    - ADR-26022: Standardization of Public Documentation Hosting on GitHub Pages.
* ADR Migration:
    - All 17 pre-existing ADRs (26001–26016) migrated to standardized format with YAML
      frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `date`, `status`, `tags`), hyphen-style headers, and
      Title/Date/Status body sections.
    - ADR index reorganized into Active Architecture / Evolutionary Proposals partitions.
* Hub-Spoke Ecosystem:
    - `architecture/packages/` directory created for ecosystem-wide package specifications.
    - vadocs package specification added (`architecture/packages/vadocs.md`).
    - Ecosystem development workflow guide added
      (`tools/docs/packages/ecosystem_package_development_workflow.md`).
* vadocs Package Lifecycle (v0.1.0):
    - Scaffolded as `vadoc` with core models, validators (ADR, Frontmatter, MystGlossary),
      fixers (ADR, Sync), 26 tests passing.
    - Renamed `vadoc` → `vadocs`, added config module, integration tests, PoC docs.
    - Extracted to dedicated repository (github.com/lefthand67/vadocs) after successful PoC;
      all package sources removed from monorepo.
* New Articles:
    - ai_system/5_context/reflected_metadata_pattern.md — reflected-metadata pattern
      explaining why `myst build --html` ignores custom YAML fields.
    - ai_system/5_context/yaml_frontmatter_for_ai_enabled_engineering.md — YAML frontmatter
      guide with real `aidx` examples and corrected MyST-build framing.
* Rewritten Articles:
    - ai_system/2_model/selection/choosing_model_size.md rewritten as VRAM budgeting guide —
      KV Cache, quantization, production patterns (Verifier Cascade, Hybrid Routing),
      `aidx` pipeline roles, Jan 2026 model zoo.
* Deleted Articles:
    - ai_system/4_orchestration/patterns/llm_usage_patterns.md deleted per ADR-26021 —
      superseded by `aidx` framework; 101-level taxonomy below repo quality bar.
* Bug Fixes:
    - MyST term references fixed across 11 ADR files and 3 content files
      (`{term}\`ADR 26001\`` → `{term}\`ADR-26001\``).
    - ADR-26019: dropped phantom HTML-anchor mechanism (never implemented), corrected
      CLI-invisibility claim to the actual gap (myst build ignoring custom YAML fields).
* CI/CD & Quality:
    - `quality.yml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` updated for `check_adr.py`.
    - `misc/` added to broken-links exclusion list in `paths.py`.
    - ADR template updated with Date/Status sections and YAML frontmatter schema.
* Development Workflow (CLAUDE.md):
    - TDD approach clarified (Red → Green → Refactor, tests-first emphasis).
    - Non-brittle test quality standards added (test contracts, semantic assertions).
* Documentation:
    - Onboarding (`00_onboarding.md`) updated with metadata conventions section.
    - 12 implementation plans added to `misc/plan/`.
