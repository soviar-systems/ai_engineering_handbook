# ADR 26008: Selection of Reasoning-Class Models for Abstract Synthesis (Phase 0)

## Title

Mandating the use of General-Purpose "Reasoning-Class" LLMs for Phase 0 to ensure maximum logic depth and abstract synthesis.

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2026-01-16

## Context

As established in {term}`ADR 26006`, the **Phase 2 (Architect)** role requires **Agentic-Class** models optimized for "Workflow Adherence" and rigid instruction following. However, **Phase 0 (Intent Synthesis)** {term}`ADR 26007` represents a different cognitive requirement:

* **Abstract Synthesis**: The model must synthesize vague human ideas into a cohesive, structured architectural plan.
* **Reasoning Ceiling**: High-level logic (e.g., GPQA Diamond benchmarks) is required to identify hidden technical debt or architectural contradictions before they reach the local editor.
* **Conversational Nuance**: Unlike the "Rigid Architect," the Phase 0 model must be a "Thinking Partner" capable of multi-modal analysis and deep-dive logic.

## Decision

We mandate the use of **Reasoning-Class (Abstract Synthesis)** models for the Phase 0 gateway.

1. **Primary Criteria**: Models must be selected based on their **Reasoning Ceiling** (GPQA/AIME scores) rather than instruction adherence alone.

2. **Permitted Models**: Only SOTA reasoning models are approved for this phase. The actual list of models is available in ["General Purpose (Abstract Synthesis) vs Agentic (Instruction Adherence) Models"](/ai_system/2_model/selection/general_purpose_vs_agentic_models.ipynb) and should be considered the Single Source of Truth when choosing the model.

3. **Role Separation**: These models are strictly forbidden for the **Phase 2 (Architect)** role (unless configured in a high-adherence sub-mode) to prevent "Instruction Drift".

## Consequences

### Positive

* **High-Fidelity Planning**: Leveraging the logic ceiling of the world's most capable models ensures a robust foundation for the local stack.
* **Ambiguity Resolution**: These models excel at identifying what the Human Lead *didn't* say, preventing downstream hallucinations.

### Negative

* **High Latency/Cost**: Reasoning-class models are significantly slower and more expensive than the Agentic-class models (like Gemini 3 Flash) used in Phase 2. **Mitigation**: Since this is a one-time "Phase 0" gateway, the cost is offset by the reduction in token waste during Phase 2 and 3.
* **Reduced Instruction Adherence**: These models may attempt to "over-engineer" the plan. **Mitigation**: The Human Lead must strictly enforce the use of the `aidx` templates during the final mission synthesis.

## Alternatives

* **Using Agentic Models (Phase 2 Models) for Phase 0**: Rejected. Models like Gemini 3 Flash (non-thinking mode) are optimized for speed and adherence but often lack the "Deep Thinking" necessary for complex problem elaboration.
