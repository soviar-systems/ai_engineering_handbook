# ADR-26018: Universal YAML Frontmatter Adoption for Machine-Readable Documentation

## Title

Universal YAML Frontmatter Adoption for Machine-Readable Documentation

## Date

2026-02-02

## Status
proposed

## Context
Our repository contains heterogeneous documentation formats, including MyST Markdown handbooks (`.md`) and Jupytext-paired notebooks (`.ipynb`). Currently, metadata such as ownership, versioning, and status are often embedded as unstructured markdown text in the document body.

This creates significant technical debt:
1. **AI Parseability**: LLMs and AI agents (e.g., Aider, Gemini) lack a deterministic interface to query document state, forcing them to rely on expensive and error-prone prose parsing.
2. **Automation Barriers**: CLI tools cannot efficiently audit the documentation library (e.g., "Find all stale docs older than 6 months") without complex regex logic.
3. **Traceability Decay**: Without a machine-readable schema, maintaining link integrity and lifecycle status (as defined in ADR-26016) across the entire stack is manually intensive and unverifiable [ISO 29148: Verifiability].

## Decision
We will mandate the adoption of YAML frontmatter as the **Universal Interface** for all documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.ipynb` via Jupytext) in the repository.

1. **Mandatory Schema**: Every file must contain a YAML block with at least `owner`, `version`, and `last_modified` fields.
2. **Jupytext Integration**: For notebooks, the YAML metadata must reside in the paired MyST Markdown file to ensure it is easily diffable and searchable via standard CLI tools.
3. **AI Tooling Alignment**: This structured block serves as the primary context injection point for AI assistants, ensuring they understand the "Freshness" and "Authority" of the document before processing the content.
4. **Human-Machine Sync**: To ensure human readability in non-rendering environments (like CLI `cat`), a standardized "Reflection Block" will be injected into the body, automatically synced from the YAML source via pre-commit hooks.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Deterministic Context**: AI tools gain 100% accuracy in identifying document metadata, reducing hallucination risk regarding document status.
- **Library Auditing**: Enables the use of `yq` and `frontmatter` parsers to generate automated indexes and freshness reports.
- **SVA Compliance**: Maintains a CLI-first, vendor-neutral approach to documentation state.
- **RAG**: The transition to a Universal YAML Frontmatter is a prerequisite for high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vectorized storage. In a vectorized database, the decision to move metadata from prose to YAML directly impacts the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** during the embedding and retrieval process.

### Negative / Risks
- **Metadata Redundancy**: If not automated, humans must maintain two blocks. **Mitigation**: Implementation of a `pre-commit` hook to automate the projection of YAML into the body text.
- **Sync Overhead**: Jupytext files require strict synchronization to prevent metadata drift between the `.md` and `.ipynb` files. **Mitigation**: Automated `jupytext --sync` commands in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Alternatives
- **Manual Prose Headers**: Rejected. Not parseable by machines and prone to formatting drift.
- **Database-Stored Metadata**: Rejected. Violates the principle of Git as the Single Source of Truth and adds unnecessary architectural complexity.
- **MyST-Only Metadata**: Rejected. Standard MyST frontmatter is invisible to humans in many raw terminal/Git environments.
