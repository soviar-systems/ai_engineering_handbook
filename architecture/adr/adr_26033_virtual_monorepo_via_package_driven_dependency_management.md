# ADR-26033: Virtual Monorepo via Package-Driven Dependency Management

## Date
2026-02-25

## Status
proposed

## Context
Managing spoke projects {term}`ADR-26020` as separate repos creates friction for developers who need to "dogfood" changes across the stack.

## Decision
Standardize on **`uv` Workspace-linked Packages** to create a "Virtual Monorepo" during development. Use internal PyPI/Git-based installs for production.

## Consequences

Need to be finished.

## Alternatives
- **Git Submodules:** Linking repos via `.gitmodules`. **Rejection Reason:** High "Maintenance Tax." Submodules are notoriously difficult to keep in sync and often lead to "Detached HEAD" states for developers.
- **Traditional Monorepo:** Merging all code into one giant repository. **Rejection Reason:** Violates the Hub-and-Spoke model. Prevents independent versioning of the `vadocs` engine and the `skills` library, which have different release cycles.
