# ADR-26038: Context Engineering as Core Design Principle

## Date
2026-03-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Agentic OS concept ({term}`ADR-26034`, [A-26002: Agentic OS, Tiered Cognitive Memory, and Package-Driven Infrastructure](/architecture/evidence/analyses/A-26002_agentic_os_skills_tiered_memory_package_infra.md)) positions documentation as a filesystem and skills as composable applications. However, a comprehensive landscape analysis ([A-26009: Compass — The Realistic State of Agentic AI Architectures in Early 2026](/architecture/evidence/analyses/A-26009_compass_realistic_state_of_agentic_ai_2026.md)) reveals a consistent pattern across production deployments: **context engineering, not architectural sophistication, determines agent success**.

Key evidence from [A-26009](/architecture/evidence/analyses/A-26009_compass_realistic_state_of_agentic_ai_2026.md):

1. **Vercel's text-to-SQL agent**: Stripping from 15+ tools to 2 improved success rate from 80% to 100%, reduced tokens by 40%. Their conclusion: "We were doing the model's thinking for it."

2. **UC Berkeley MAST taxonomy** (NeurIPS 2025): Analysis of 1,600+ traces across 7 frameworks found multi-agent system correctness as low as 25%. Best-effort interventions yielded only +14% improvement.

3. **Cognition (Devin, $73M ARR)**: Published "Don't Build Multi-Agents" — multi-agent systems are inherently fragile due to context isolation between sub-agents.

4. **Single-agent with skills study** ([arXiv:2601.04748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04748), January 2026): Single agents with skill libraries "substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy" compared to multi-agent approaches.

5. **Claude Code ($1B run-rate)**: Fundamentally a single-agent tool-use loop — LLM + tools in a loop, not elaborate orchestration.

6. **NVIDIA RULER benchmark**: Effective context is only 50-65% of advertised window size. Llama 3.1-70B accuracy drops from 96.5% at 4K tokens to 66.6% at 128K.

7. **MIT/Kellogg finding**: 80% of work in production agent projects is data engineering, governance, and workflow integration — not the AI itself.

The ecosystem's Agentic OS design has been evolving toward increasing architectural complexity (VFS layers, Virtual Relational Layers, document type registries). This ADR establishes the constraint that prevents over-engineering: **context engineering is the core primitive, and every architectural addition must justify its existence by improving context management**.

### The Catalyst: Mentor Generator

These patterns emerged from building [Mentor Generator](https://github.com/soviar-systems/mentor_generator), the first application on this OS. Mentor Generator is an AI-powered system that creates personalized learning courses: it interviews a user about their goals and background, researches contemporary sources on the chosen topic, assembles a structured curriculum with a teaching persona (tone, Socratic questioning style, strictness level), and then conducts interactive learning sessions. The project uses litellm for provider-agnostic LLM connectivity (any API, any model).

During the v0.31.0-v0.41.0 evolution (documented in [A-26002](/architecture/evidence/analyses/A-26002_agentic_os_skills_tiered_memory_package_infra.md)), three systemic failures became undeniable: Cognitive Overload (monolithic prompt causing Instruction Drift), Context Tax (reference data competing with procedural logic for the finite context window), and Distribution Friction (no versioned, testable unit of expertise). These are not Mentor-specific — they apply to any agent that must combine domain expertise with structured output generation.

The production mentor requires:
- A single agent dispatching skills (interview, research, generation, mentoring)
- Shared RAG backed by a vector store for semantic memory (vector store standardization is a separate architectural decision)
- Proactive context window management with token counting
- Session persistence via course_history (episodic memory)

This is a context engineering problem, not an orchestration problem.

## Decision

We adopt **context engineering as the core design principle** for the Agentic OS ecosystem. This means:

1. **Single-agent architecture with skill dispatch.** The agent is one process that loads skills on demand (progressive disclosure). Skills are injected instructions, not separate agents. The SKILL.md format, structure, and selection mechanism are specified in [ADR-26044](/architecture/adr/adr_26044_skills_as_progressive_disclosure_units.md), grounded in cross-vendor convergence documented in [A-26009](/architecture/evidence/analyses/A-26009_compass_realistic_state_of_agentic_ai_2026.md).

2. **Three-tier memory as the primary abstraction.**
   - **Working memory**: Current context window, managed by token-aware budget tracking
   - **Episodic memory**: Session history, persisted to disk, paged in on demand
   - **Semantic memory**: Long-term knowledge in a vector store, retrieved via semantic search

3. **Context budget as a first-class constraint.** Every document, skill, and tool output has a token cost. The signal-to-noise ratio of prompt delivery format is itself an architectural decision — see [Format as Architecture: Signal-to-Noise in Prompt Delivery](/ai_system_layers/3_prompts/format_as_architecture_signal_noise_in_prompt_delivery.ipynb) for the detailed analysis and empirical measurements. The agent tracks cumulative context usage and acts proactively:
   - (a) Context almost full: summarize and continue (page fault → swap)
   - (b) User stops: graceful save of session state (SIGTERM → checkpoint)
   - (c) Goals complete: persist outcomes and exit cleanly (exit(0) → write result)

4. **Architectural additions require context engineering justification.** Any new layer, abstraction, or component must demonstrate that it improves the agent's ability to manage, retrieve, or budget context. If a feature does not make context management better, it is rejected as over-engineering. This operationalizes {term}`ADR-26037` (Smallest Viable Architecture) for the agent runtime.

5. **Tool minimalism.** Fewer, well-chosen tools outperform many specialized tools (Vercel evidence). The agent starts with a minimal tool set (RAG retrieval, web search, file I/O) and tools are added only when a concrete use case proves the existing set insufficient.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Prevents the "Agentic OS as grand architecture" trap identified in [A-26009](/architecture/evidence/analyses/A-26009_compass_realistic_state_of_agentic_ai_2026.md) — the system grows from a working runtime, not top-down design
- Aligns with every production success story in the compass analysis (Claude Code, Cursor, Vercel, Devin)
- Token budget awareness prevents the cost explosion documented in [A-26009](/architecture/evidence/analyses/A-26009_compass_realistic_state_of_agentic_ai_2026.md) (agentic apps re-send context 10-50x per session)
- Skills as injected instructions (not sub-agents) eliminate the context isolation problem that kills multi-agent systems
- Three-tier memory maps directly to Mentor Generator's existing architecture (context window / session history / knowledge base)
- Format-aware context delivery maximizes instructional signal per attention-weighted token. [Format as Architecture](/ai_system_layers/3_prompts/format_as_architecture_signal_noise_in_prompt_delivery.ipynb) demonstrates up to 21% token cost difference between formats on identical content (2,306 vs 2,798 tokens), and Mentor Generator post-mortems (v0.40.0 → v0.41.0) confirmed that switching from JSON to YAML improved compiler fidelity from catastrophic drift to ~95% adherence on the same model (Qwen3-Max)

### Negative / Risks

- Single-agent architecture may hit scaling limits for truly independent parallel tasks. **Mitigation:** The constraint says "start single-agent" — it does not prohibit adding concurrency when proven necessary, but the proposer must demonstrate the need. The approved scaling pattern is **fork-and-join subagents** (parent delegates subtasks to child processes while retaining full context), as distinct from multi-agent swarms where independent agents negotiate with each other
- Token counting accuracy varies across providers (not all expose exact counts). **Mitigation:** design for approximate budgets with safety margins; the token counting library provides best-effort estimates
- Progressive disclosure requires good metadata (descriptions, tags, token_size) on all documents and skills. **Mitigation:** A common frontmatter standard ({term}`ADR-26042`) will establish these fields; vadocs validates compliance

## Alternatives

- **Multi-agent orchestration (CrewAI, AutoGen pattern).** Multiple specialized agents with delegation. **Rejection Reason:** Empirically fragile — Berkeley MAST taxonomy shows 25% correctness floor, context isolation between agents causes incompatible decisions (Cognition). CrewAI consumes 3x tokens for simple tasks (AIMultiple benchmark).

- **Framework-heavy approach (LangGraph state machines).** Model the agent as a graph with typed state passing and checkpointing. **Rejection Reason:** 45% of LangChain users never deployed to production, 23% who deployed eventually removed it (Adaline analysis). Adds abstraction layers that obscure prompts and responses (Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" warning).

- **Architecture-first OS design.** Build the full VFS, VRL, Document Type Registry, then write applications on top. **Rejection Reason:** [A-26009](/architecture/evidence/analyses/A-26009_compass_realistic_state_of_agentic_ai_2026.md) concludes the winner will "emerge from a working runtime that accretes capabilities because developers keep needing one more thing." The [GEMM Engineering Standard](/ai_system_layers/1_execution/algebra_gemm_engineering_standard.ipynb) documents how the BLAS interface survived 50+ years of implementation changes — not because it was designed top-down, but because it was extracted from working LINPACK code (a production linear algebra library written at Argonne National Laboratory in the 1970s). The interface became the standard precisely because it codified patterns that were already proven in practice. The same principle applies here: extract the OS primitives from the working Mentor Generator runtime, don't design them in isolation.
