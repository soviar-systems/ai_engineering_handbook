# ADR-26005: Formalization of Aider as the Primary Agentic Orchestrator

## Title

Standardizing AI-assisted development and automation using the `aider` orchestration framework in a Hybrid Architect-Editor configuration.

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2026-01-14

## Context

Our environment requires high-integrity CI/CD and automation while operating on bare-metal systems with limited VRAM (Fedora/Debian stack). We face a critical "Switching Moment" bottleneck where local 14B models (e.g., `qwen2.5-coder`) suffer from context overload and GPU crashes when inheriting full conversational histories from high-reasoning cloud models. Furthermore, we must adhere to:

* {term}`ADR-26001`: Python/OOP standards for all automation logic.
* {term}`ADR-26002`: Orchestration via the `pre-commit` framework.
* {term}`ADR-26003`: Strict Tiered Workflow enforcement via `gitlint`.
* {term}`ADR-26004`: Integration with Agentic RAG for knowledge retrieval.

## Decision

We will adopt `aider` as our primary agentic tool, implemented through a **Two-Pass Hybrid Bridge** to maintain architectural integrity and resource efficiency.

1. **Hybrid Configuration**: We will utilize a Cloud Architect (e.g., Gemini 3 Flash) for high-reasoning planning and a Local Editor (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder 14B) for code implementation.
2. **State Isolation (The Bridge Pattern)**: To prevent VRAM crashes, the Architect and Editor phases will be decoupled. The Architect will generate a standalone `artifacts/plan.md` file, and the Editor will be initialized with a clean context to apply only that plan.
3. **OOP Python Wrapper**: Following {term}`ADR-26001`, we will not use raw Shell scripts for complex aider workflows. Instead, we will use the `aider` Python API (`aider.coders`) to build testable, class-based orchestrators (e.g., an `aidx` utility).
4. **Workflow Enforcement**: Aider's execution will be gated by `pre-commit` hooks and `gitlint` to ensure all generated code and commits meet Tier 3 standards.

## Consequences

### Positive

* **VRAM Stability**: Decoupling the "Architect" reasoning from the "Editor" execution prevents the  context growth that crashes local 14B models.
* **Data Sovereignty**: Highly sensitive code-writing tasks remain local, while only abstract planning is sent to cloud APIs.
* **Architectural Traceability**: Formalizing plans in `artifacts/plan.md` provides an audit trail for AI decisions.
* **ADR Compliance**: Using the Python API ensures all AI orchestration logic is unit-testable via `pytest` per {term}`ADR-26001`.

### Negative

* **Manual Bridge Overhead**: The Two-Pass approach requires explicit hand-off between planning and execution phases. **Mitigation**: Automate this via the `HybridOrchestrator` Python class and `aidx` (see {term}`ADR-26004`) wrapper.
* **Context Truncation Risk**: The Editor may lack "conversational nuance" if the Architect's plan is underspecified. **Mitigation**: Use strict MyST/Markdown templates for the Architect's output to ensure all technical requirements are captured.

## Alternatives

* **Native `/architect` Mode**: Rejected due to persistent GPU OOM (Out of Memory) errors on 14B models when handling long session histories and files in context.
* **Custom Agent Framework (LangGraph/AutoGPT)**: Rejected as it violates SVA (Smallest Viable Architecture) by adding unjustified orchestration layers and vendor lock-in.
