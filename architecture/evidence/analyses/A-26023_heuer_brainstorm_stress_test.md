# A-26023: Heuer Brainstorm: Stress-Testing Integration Conclusions

+++

## Problem Statement

+++

Analysis `A-26019` proposes integrating Richard Heuer's intelligence tradecraft into consultant prompts to mitigate cognitive bias. However, it remains unclear whether this integration provides genuine analytical rigor or is merely "cargo-cult" structuring. Furthermore, the architectural choice between implementing this as a single-session prompt extension versus a multi-agent sequential workflow requires validation to avoid the "Consistency Trap" (confirmation bias inherent in autoregressive generation).

## Key Insights

+++

This section presents the results of a stress-test conducted using a Senior AI Systems Architect (Hybrid Consultant) persona.

### 1. Heuer as Constrained Generation
**Verdict:** Genuinely useful structuring.
**Analysis:** The value is not in "fixing" AI cognition, but in moving the "most probable completion" from a single narrative to a structured analytical process. By mandating ACH or disconfirmation, the model is forced to attend to evidence and alternatives it would otherwise ignore in a standard "best solution" request.

### 2. Token Cost vs. Quality Trade-off
**Verdict:** Justified for high-stakes decisions.
**Analysis:** For trivial tasks, the 200-300 token overhead is inefficient. For architectural decisions (WRC < 0.90), the cost of a "satisficed" wrong answer far outweighs the token cost. The `ach_mandatory` trigger correctly balances efficiency and rigor.

### 3. Prerequisite: Linchpin Analysis
**Verdict:** Mandatory for ACH viability.
**Analysis:** ACH without Linchpin Analysis risks building a structured house on sand. The "Light" version should be: **Linchpin Identification $\rightarrow$ ACH $\rightarrow$ Probability Quantification**.

### 4. Archetype Sensitivity
**Verdict:** Most critical for Hybrid and Local consultants.
**Analysis:** DevOps tasks are often binary/factual. Hybrid/Local architecture involves "soft" trade-offs with no single correct answer, making them most susceptible to satisficing and bias.

### 5. The "Transformer Satisficing" Hypothesis
**Verdict:** Useful analogy, mechanistically distinct.
**Analysis:** Human satisficing is a cognitive shortcut. Transformer "satisficing" is a result of next-token prediction and greedy decoding. Maintain as a research hypothesis in `A-26019`.

### 6. Prompt Refinement Recommendations
- **Dynamic Triggering:** Add a "Criticality" flag to trigger ACH regardless of model confidence.
- **Diagnosticity focus:** Refine the ACH matrix to emphasize *diagnosticity* over simple pros/cons.
- **Justified Probabilities:** Link numerical probability ranges explicitly to evidence found in the ACH matrix.

## Approach Evaluation

### The "Consistency Trap" and Cognitive Momentum
A critical vulnerability in single-session LLM reasoning is the **Consistency Trap**. Due to autoregressive generation, once a model produces a "most likely" hypothesis, that text enters the context window and creates **Cognitive Momentum**. 

The model then performs **Performative Refutation**: it follows instructions to "challenge" the hypothesis, but the drive for logical coherence steers the reasoning back toward the initial conclusion. The result is a "Mental Set" where the LLM filters data to fit its first guess.

### The "Cognitive Firewall" Solution
To mitigate this, a **Sequential Agent Architecture** is recommended over a single session. By handing off results between fresh agent instances, we break the linear momentum and create a "firewall" against confirmation bias.

**Proposed Analytic Pipeline:**
1. **Divergent Agent (Hypothesis Generation):** Generates $N$ competing hypotheses without ranking.
2. **Evidence Mapper (Matrix Construction):** Maps data against hypotheses, explicitly identifying contradictory data.
3. **Adversarial Agent (The Refuter):** Fresh instance tasked specifically to "kill" the leading hypothesis.
4. **Synthesis Agent (The Arbiter):** Final conclusion based on the hypothesis most resilient to refutation.

### Applying Heuer to CoT
To move CoT from "intuitive" (System 1) to "structured" (System 2), the following patterns should be implemented:
- **Pre-CoT Assumption Auditing:** Explicitly list and question assumptions before proceeding.
- **Divergent CoT:** Replace linear paths with multi-path evaluation (Hypothesis A, B, C $\rightarrow$ Evidence $\rightarrow$ Conclusion).
- **Calibration:** Force the inclusion of "Degrees of Certainty" or confidence intervals for each logical step.
