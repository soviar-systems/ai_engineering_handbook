# A-26018: XML Tags as Scope Boundaries — Prompt Architecture and Injection Resistance

+++

## Problem Statement

+++

Structural tokens such as XML tags are often dismissed as "noise" — overhead that increases prompt token count without carrying semantic content. The question from `S-26016` is whether XML tags in prompts function as noise or as meaningful architectural elements. The answer determines when XML is the right choice and how it should be integrated with other formats (YAML, JSON) in a production prompt pipeline.

+++

## Key Insights

+++

### 1. XML Tags Are Scope Boundaries, Not Noise

XML tags carry two distinct properties that whitespace-based formats (YAML, Markdown) cannot provide:

- **Named scope boundaries.** Each `</tag>` explicitly closes its scope, making hierarchy unambiguous even without indentation. A reader — human or transformer — cannot mistake the end of a section.
- **Repeated key tokens.** The tag name appears at both the opening (`<tag>`) and closing (`</tag>`), giving the model explicit paired anchors at each structural boundary. Transformer attention heads trained on structured text use these paired signals to segment the prompt into semantically meaningful blocks.

This makes XML more expensive per field than YAML (roughly 20–25 tokens of overhead for a 4-key snippet vs zero for YAML) but uniquely resistant to the structural ambiguity that enables injection attacks.

The token overhead is the price for the scope guarantee. When scope integrity matters, it is the right trade-off.

### 2. Markdown Headers Define Soft Boundaries; XML Tags Define Hard Boundaries

Markdown section boundaries are **implied**: the end of a section is signalled by the start of the next header (`##`), not by an explicit delimiter. There is no closing marker.

Consequences:
- A prompt injection that adds content before the next header silently extends the current section.
- Downstream parsing of Markdown section content is ambiguous — there is no machine-readable end-of-section signal.
- Machine-readable key-value access (e.g., extracting `section_name.field`) is not reliably possible from Markdown.

XML tags are **explicit**: `</tag>` terminates the scope regardless of content. An injected payload cannot extend scope without producing a well-formedness violation.

### 3. Training Distribution: XML Tags as System/User/Assistant Delimiters

Modern LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Qwen) are trained on chat templates that use XML-like tags to delimit system, user, and assistant roles. Examples: Anthropic's own system prompts use XML tags extensively for scope isolation; many open-weight model chat templates use `<|im_start|>` / `<|im_end|>` or equivalent XML-adjacent markers.

This training distribution means current models have strong learned associations between XML-style delimiters and structural role boundaries. XML tags in prompts activate the same learned attention patterns used for conversation role segmentation — a reliable mechanism for current models.

### 4. The Hybrid YAML+XML Pattern

YAML and XML are not competing choices — they compose naturally:

- **YAML** for static instructions: low token noise, strong attention anchors via indentation, optimal for structured configuration-style prompts.
- **XML tags** at dynamic injection boundaries: explicit scope delimiters around untrusted user content, preventing out-indenting and injection attacks.

A prompt that combines both gets YAML's efficiency for the stable instruction body and XML's scope safety for variable content:

```yaml
instructions:
  role: DevOps Consultant
  constraints:
    - No proprietary tools
    - Prefer shell scripts
runtime_data:
  user_query:
    - <query>
    - REPLACE_USER_INPUT
    - </query>
```

### 5. JSON-List Injection Boundary Pattern

When the prompt source is JSON (compiled, validated, version-controlled) and delivered as YAML (via a conversion pipeline), XML tags embedded in JSON string values survive conversion intact. However, embedding XML tags as raw string values introduces escaped newlines in JSON.

The pattern from `S-26016`: store the XML wrapper as a **JSON list** where each element is one line:

```json
{
  "runtime_data": {
    "user_query": ["<query>", "REPLACE_USER_INPUT", "</query>"]
  }
}
```

After JSON-to-YAML conversion, the list renders as a YAML block sequence with one item per line, and the `<query>` tags appear as clean terminal anchors without escaped newlines. This keeps the JSON source readable and the YAML output clean — no custom injection scripting required.
