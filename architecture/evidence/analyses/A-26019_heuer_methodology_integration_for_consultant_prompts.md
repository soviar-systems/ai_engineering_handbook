# A-26019: Heuer Methodology Integration for Consultant Prompts

+++

## Problem Statement

+++

The ecosystem's WRC-bearing consultant prompts (`ai_systems_consultant_hybrid.json`, `local_ai_systems_consultant.json`, `devops_consultant.json`) contain bias mitigation principles but lack executable analytical tradecraft. The question from `S-26019` is whether Richard Heuer's *Psychology of Intelligence Analysis* (1999) should be integrated as instructions, RAG, or not at all — and if integrated, what specific techniques map to the prompt architecture.

The answer determines whether Heuer's framework improves LLM output quality for architectural decision-making, and what the integration mechanism should be.

+++

## Key Insights

+++

### 1. Heuer Is Procedural Enforcement, Not Informational Retrieval

The central finding: Heuer's value lies in the *method* (ACH, structuring, bias checks), not the *text*. Embedding as instructions enforces the cognitive model; storing as RAG provides data but not discipline.

Evidence from `S-26019` (msg 5, Qwen 3.5 analysis):

- **Process vs. Data**: Chapter 8 (ACH) requires *active steps* — identify hypotheses, evaluate evidence diagnosticity, reject least consistent. A RAG-retrieved passage about ACH does not force the model to *execute* it.
- **Information Diminishing Returns**: Chapter 5 demonstrates that additional information does not improve accuracy once the minimum is met; better *processing* does.
- **Satisficing Override**: Without explicit instructions, the transformer defaults to single-hypothesis confirmation even if the Heuer text is available in context.

The hybrid approach — instructions for process, RAG for citations — scored WRC 0.94 in the Qwen analysis. Instructions-only scored 0.90. RAG-only scored 0.75, failing production-ready threshold.

### 2. Transformer Satisficing Mirrors Human Cognitive Bias

The Qwen dialogue (`S-26019`, msg 3) proposes a structural parallel: autoregressive next-token prediction resembles Heuer's "satisficing" (Chapter 4) — selecting the first acceptable hypothesis without exploring alternatives.

- **Human satisficing** (Heuer): analyst accepts the first plausible explanation and stops searching.
- **Autoregressive generation**: selects the highest-probability continuation at each step, which may suppress lower-probability alternatives.
- **Observed behavior**: unconstrained generation tends to produce confident, single-narrative outputs. Structured instructions (ACH, methodology comparison) produce multi-hypothesis outputs.

The parallel is suggestive but unverified: autoregressive greedy decoding is a well-established property of the generation algorithm, but whether this causes the same failure modes as human satisficing in analytical tasks — and whether the effect worsens under token pressure (long contexts degrading instruction-following) — requires empirical testing. The claim that "transformer satisficing" is mechanistically equivalent to human satisficing should be treated as a research hypothesis, not an established fact.

What *is* empirically observable: prompts with explicit ACH instructions produce outputs containing alternative hypotheses that the same model without those instructions does not generate. Whether this is because the instructions override a "satisficing tendency" or simply because they expand the output template is an open question.

**Analytical note (Claude Opus 4.6 review):** There is a gap between "autoregressive generation is greedy" (well-established property of the decoding algorithm) and "this greediness causes the same failure modes as human satisficing in intelligence analysis" (unverified claim about output quality). The former is a mathematical property of beam search / top-k sampling. The latter is a claim about semantic behavior that would require controlled experiments: same prompt with and without ACH instructions, evaluated by domain experts for hypothesis coverage and conclusion quality. Until such evidence exists, the parallel should inform prompt design intuitively — not be cited as established science.

### 3. ACH as Mandatory Protocol for Methodology Comparison

Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (Chapter 8) maps directly to the existing "Methodology Comparison" table in consultant prompts. The table already functions as an informal ACH matrix — evaluating multiple approaches against evidence dimensions.

The refinement from `S-26019` makes this explicit:

- **Current state**: prompts ask for a "Methodology Comparison" table with pros/cons and WRC scores.
- **Heuer-aligned state**: the table becomes an ACH matrix where evidence is evaluated for *diagnosticity* — how well it discriminates between alternatives, not just how well it supports the leading option.
- **Trigger**: mandatory for high-stakes decisions (WRC < 0.90 or production-ready classification).

The existing `output_protocol` section 7 (Methodology Comparison) already partially implements ACH. The gap is making diagnosticity explicit and mandating disconfirmation of the leading hypothesis.

### 4. Disconfirmation Priority Over Confirmation

Heuer's Disconfirmation Principle (Chapters 4, 8) aligns with the existing `peer_review` principle in consultant prompts but makes it operationally specific:

- **Current**: "Internally peer review your answer before final output for objectivity."
- **Heuer-aligned**: "Before finalizing, explicitly seek evidence that *refutes* the leading recommendation. If no refuting evidence is found, state why the alternative hypotheses were less consistent."

This is Popperian logic applied to LLM output: a hypothesis gains credibility not from confirming evidence (which is easy to generate) but from surviving disconfirmation attempts.

### 5. Linchpin Analysis for Assumption Identification

The existing "Assumption Interrogation" table in consultant output maps to Heuer's Linchpin Analysis (Chapter 6), but with a critical gap:

- **Current**: lists assumptions with verification status.
- **Heuer-aligned**: identifies which assumptions are *linchpins* — the ones that, if wrong, would change the conclusion entirely.

The refinement requires an explicit "impact" column: does this assumption drive the recommendation, or is it peripheral? This focuses human review on the assumptions that matter most, rather than treating all assumptions equally.

### 6. Heuer Structures Human Consumption, Not AI Cognition

A category clarification that prevents misapplication: Heuer's tradecraft does not "fix AI thinking" (AI has no mental machinery). It serves two distinct purposes:

- **Generation-side**: forces the model to produce structured, multi-hypothesis outputs instead of single-narrative satisficing. This is format engineering, not cognitive correction.
- **Consumption-side**: provides the human reader with externalized reasoning (Chapter 7), quantified uncertainty (Chapter 12), and audit trails (Chapter 14) that counter the reader's own biases when evaluating AI output.

The generation-side benefit is real but indirect: structure constraints reduce hallucination by forcing the model to "show work" that can be verified. The consumption-side benefit is the primary value proposition for industrial decision support.

### 7. Concrete Integration Blueprint from Qwen Dialogue

`S-26019` msg 11 contains Qwen 3.5's refined version of `ai_systems_consultant_hybrid.json` with Heuer integration. The key additions (documented in msg 13's change audit):

| Prompt Section | Addition | Heuer Source |
|---|---|---|
| `system.principles` | `bias_mitigation` — Disconfirmation Principle as active directive | Chapter 4, 8 |
| `system.principles` | `heuristics_mitigation` — Availability, Anchoring, Mirror-Imaging checks | Chapter 9-13 |
| `system.principles` | `ach_mandatory` — trigger for structured alternative analysis | Chapter 8 |
| `consulting_protocol.core_context` | `tradecraft_standards` — four Heuer requirements | Chapter 14 |
| `internal_execution_protocols` | `heuristics_check_protocol` — 4-step: Linchpin → Disconfirmation → Bias Scan → Uncertainty | Chapter 6, 8, 12, 14 |
| `thinking_protocol` | Added bias check and peer review steps | Chapter 14 |

Token overhead: ~200-300 tokens per prompt. The Qwen analysis rated this WRC 0.91 (production-ready).

+++

## Rejected Ideas

+++

### RAG-Only Tradecraft

Storing Heuer's text in a vector database for retrieval on demand. Rejected because retrieval does not guarantee execution — the model can retrieve ACH steps but skip them if not instructed to perform them. WRC 0.75, below production-ready threshold.

### No Integration

Keeping current implicit bias mitigation (`peer_review` principle only). Rejected because implicit guidance appears to be overridden by the transformer's satisficing tendency under token pressure (hypothesis — requires empirical verification; see Insight #2 analytical note). The current prompts produce single-narrative outputs that miss alternative hypotheses.

### Full Heuer Text in System Prompt

Embedding the complete book content. Rejected as disproportionate — the value is in the method (a few hundred tokens of instructions), not the full text (hundreds of thousands of tokens of analysis examples and Cold War case studies).
