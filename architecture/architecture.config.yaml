# Architecture Configuration - Shared vocabulary for the Architecture Knowledge Base
#
# This is the parent config for all architecture-specific YAML configs.
# Child configs (adr_config.yaml, evidence.config.yaml) inherit shared fields
# from here instead of duplicating them.
#
# Governed by: ADR-26036 (Config File Location and Naming Conventions)
# Location convention: lives next to the artifacts it governs (architecture/)

# =============================================================================
# Valid tags — shared vocabulary for all architectural artifacts
# =============================================================================
# Used by: ADRs, analyses, retrospectives
# Adding a tag here makes it available to all artifact types.
