    "This document maps the AI System Lifecycle to the foundational disciplines defined by the **ACM/IEEE Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula** (available at [https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations)). This provides a structured, globally-adopted context for the roles and required expertise within the generic AI Engineering team. AI Engineering is viewed here as an **emergent, convergent domain**, synthesizing principles from multiple computing disciplines.\n",

    "## Breakdown of AI Grounding (Production Context)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hardware & Optimization (AIH)**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Grounded in:** **Computer Engineering** (CE2016).\n",
    "      * **Production Context:** Covers high-performance computing clusters and hardware-software co-design. This is where **systems thinking** and low-level optimization (memory, latency) are applied to specialized accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Training & Modeling (AIT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Grounded in:** **ML/Statistical Foundations** (CCDS2021).\n",
    "      * **Production Context:** The engineering application of these principles is **Machine Learning Engineering (MLE)**, focused on reproducible training, model versioning, bias mitigation, and data pipeline integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Deployment & MLOps (AID)**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Grounded in:** **Software Engineering** (SE2014), **Information Technology** (IT2017), and **Cybersecurity** (CSEC2017).\n",
    "      * **Production Context:** This phase synthesizes multiple disciplines and **must be augmented by MLOps/SRE principles**, which go beyond the scope of older curricula. Adherence to standards like **ISO/IEC 23053 (AI Engineering Framework)** and **ISO/IEC 29148 (Requirements Engineering)** is mandatory.\n",
    "          * **Software Engineering** handles model integration into scalable, robust microservices.\n",
    "          * **Information Technology** handles the underlying cloud infrastructure, logging, and continuous performance monitoring (the \"Ops\" of MLOps).\n",
    "          * **Cybersecurity** ensures compliance, integrity, and threat-response, crucial for a trusted service.\n",
